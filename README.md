#Development

Start a node server that supports auto refresh
Server can be used at: http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

```
npm run server
```

#Production

This builds the project by creating a dir /build/
Deploy this directory to the production environment.
By doing it this way no unnecessary node modules are on the server. 

```
npm run build
```
