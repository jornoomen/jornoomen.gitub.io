#Development

Start a node server that supports auto refresh
Server can be used at: http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

```
npm run server
```

#Production

This builds the sass / js by creating a dir /build/
This way the node_modules directory can be avoided in production deployment. 

```
npm run build
```
